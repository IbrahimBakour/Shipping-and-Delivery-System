# 🚚 Shipping and Delivery System

A **Shipping and Delivery Management System** developed using **Java** and the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach.  
The system is designed to streamline logistics operations through specialized subsystems for **clothes**, **electronics**, **furniture**, and **medical supplies**, ensuring efficiency, security, and customer satisfaction.

## 🏗️ 1.0 Introduction
In an era of rapidly evolving commerce and logistics, efficient delivery systems are crucial for business success.  
This project introduces a Java-based **Shipping and Delivery System** that leverages the OOP paradigm to organize, automate, and optimize the transportation of various goods categories.

## ⚠️ 2.0 Problem Statement
Existing manual and fragmented delivery systems face operational inefficiencies, delays, and handling issues.  
To address these limitations, the project integrates **four specialized subsystems**, each focusing on a specific product category:

- **Clothing Delivery Subsystem:** Facilitates quick and reliable apparel transportation.  
- **Electronics Delivery Subsystem:** Ensures safe handling and shipping of sensitive devices.  
- **Furniture Delivery Subsystem:** Manages bulky, fragile, or heavy furniture logistics.  
- **Medical Supplies Delivery Subsystem:** Prioritizes accuracy and speed for healthcare items.

By exploiting Java’s OOP capabilities — **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism** — the system maximizes reusability and efficiency in handling complex logistics logic.

## 🎯 3.0 Objectives
- Replace inefficient manual processes with a digital Java-based system.  
- Provide faster, more reliable, and secure delivery operations.  
- Increase customer satisfaction through system reliability.  
- Improve overall system scalability and efficiency using OOP design.

---

## 🧩 4.0 Scope
The system is built as a console-based Java application with modular architecture, focusing on end-to-end shipping workflow management.

### Core Functionalities:
- Manage orders and delivery details per product category.  
- Handle data for multiple product types using class inheritance.  
- Implement error-checked data entry through OOP encapsulation.  
- Simulate real-world logistics operations across multiple domains.

---

## 🧰 Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Tools:** JDK 8+ / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans  
- **Data Handling:** File-based system or Java collections framework  

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- GUI implementation using JavaFX or Swing  
- Database integration (MySQL or MongoDB) for persistence  
- Role-based user access (Admin, Customer, Dispatcher)  
- Real-time delivery tracking simulation
